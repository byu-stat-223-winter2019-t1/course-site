## IQR (45 points)
The interquartile range (IQR) is the 75th percentile minus the 25th percentile 
and is a measure of spread.

1. Create a function called `iqr` that takes a single numeric vector, `x`, as an
argument and returns the interquartile range of `x`. You should **not** use the
built in `IQR()` function in R (10 points).
2. Use your function defined above to calculate the IQR for the data provided
in [`iqr.R`](iqr.R) (5 points).
3. Use bootstrap sampling to build a 95% confidence interval around the IQR value
you calculated in step 2 (15 points).
4. Plot a histogram of your bootstrap sample IQRs. Add red vertical lines that
represent the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval (10 points).
4. If someone said that the IQR of the population from which this data was sampled
is 0.25, what would you say about this claim (5 points)? (Answer in comments if you're

## Alabama (75 points)
Alabama has been a college football dynasty for the past decade. Over that time
frame, the program has built a legacy of strong defense that has led to multiple 
national championships. Now, this year, Alabama is experiencing an offensive 
resurgence led by sophomore quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Tua's rise to the top 
of the nation's premier program hasn't been without controversy. At the start of 
this season Tua replaced Jalen Hurts as Alabama's starting quarterback. Jalen has 
been an excellent quarterback for the Crimson Tide and owns a 26-2 record as a 
starter. As a true freshman Jalen was named the SEC Offensive Player of the year.

As this current season continues, both quarterbacks remain on the roster, and 
both have seen meaningful playing time. The question we want to answer is this: 
*does starting Tua make Alabama a better team than starting Jalen?* Now, the 
notion of what makes a "better" team is certainly one that can be debated. In 
this scenario, we're going to use Yards Per Point (YPP) Differential, as introduced 
at the [MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in 2013](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/Slides/EOS/Identifying%20an%20accurate%20metric%20for%20football%20efficiency.pdf).

Yards Per Point Differential is calculated based on Yards Per Point Defense minus
Yards Per Point Offense. Yards Per Point Defense is the total yards allowed by a
team divided by the total points scored against a team. Yards Per Point Offense 
is the total number of yards gained by a team divided by the total number of points
a team scores. This metric provides a measure of team efficiency - a high
Yards Per Point Differential indicates that a team was, on average, more efficient 
than its opponents.

The [`alabama.csv`](alabama.csv) file contains the following columns:

+ `date`: date of the game
+ `opponent`: team Alabama played against
+ `starter`: name of Alabama's starting quarterback for the game
+ `yards`: number of yards gained by Alabama
+ `yards_against`: number of yards gained by the other team
+ `points`: number of points scored by Alabama
+ `points_against`: number of points scored by the other team

Given this dataset, the following can be used to calculate Yards Per Point Differential:

$$
YPP_{diff} = YPP_{defense} - YPP_{offense}\\
YPP_{defense} = \frac{\sum \text{yards_against}}{\sum \text{points_against}}\\
YPP_{offense} = \frac{\sum \text{yards}}{\sum \text{points}}
$$

With this setup, we have the following hypotheses:

$$
H_0 = \text{Tua }YPP_{diff} = \text{Jalen } YPP_{diff}\\
H_a = \text{Tua }YPP_{diff} \gt \text{Jalen } YPP_{diff}
$$

1. Read the [`alabama.csv`](alabama.csv) file into R (10 points).
2. Calculate the observed test statistic. That is, Tua's Yards Per Point Differential
minus Jalen's Yards Per Point Differential. The starter for each game is identified
in the `starter` column (15 points).
3. Conduct a permutation test of 10,000 permutations to build a distribution of 
this test statistic under the null hypothesis (20 points).
4. Create a histogram of your results from step 3. Include a vertical red 
line indicating the original observed test statistic calculated in step 1 (10 
points).
5. Using the values derived in step 3, calculate the p-value associated
with the original observed test statistic calculated in step 1 (10 points).
6. Build a 95% confidence interval around this p-value (5 points).
7. Based on the results of your permutation test, what do you conclude (5 points)?
